# Lexical Analyzer - CPSC 323

The files in our GitHub encompass the entirety of our project. The "main.cpp" is our c++ code, the text file "input_scode.txt" is our design file, and "" is our output after lexical analysis of the input. The cpp should be able to be compiled and run simply with access to the input file, text will be read, and lexed.
